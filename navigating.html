<h2 style="text-align: center; color:; background-color:lightgrey;">Secretive Robert, Trevor's Dad <h2/>
<p style="color:azure; background:grey;"><small>This story got me interested because i experienced the same on this I never new where my dad grew up where he came from  i never heard a one on one  talk with him, .I thought i was the only who's going through this but wasn't alone. So back to Trevor Noah's story when he hear know clue about .Where his dad grew up? Where he's from? Where he went to university? how he end up in South Africa he has no clue.He has never met his swiss grandparents he doesn't know there names and anything about them.The only thing he knows about is dad is that he worked as a chef at montreal New York.He never called his dad "Dad" He was instructed not to due to the fact that when he calls him dad people may ask question or call the police so he only calls him Robert and not dad . Trevor thanks  his mom because she use to take him at his dad's place when he was young so he still have that memory of his dad when he was young .He has sense of how his dad was, he was very swiss, clean particular and precise, he also knows that his dad never married ,beacuse he used to think that people marry to contol others and so he never wanted to be controlled. He also knows that is dad love travelling he loves to be around people ,but at the same time his dad is so private, privacy means everything to his dad.Due to the privacy issue trevor says his dad is well reserved and rational unlike his mom , she's so wild and impulsive and he's so proud he is a mix of both parents.<small></p>

<p style="color:azure; background-color:blueviolet;"> Trevor also said his dad used to hate racism, not the fact that he's righteous or anything it's because he used to think it's insane for someone to come to african home and hate africans why hate them and you came all the way to there country.His dad use to love blacks untill he  ended up opening a mix restaurant, and he was give a licence on that untill the government got in between his work place to ask him to build toilets of difference category race ,and since  he never wanted such racism to happen he decided to shut down his restaurant and he went to leave where immigrant stay, trevor used to like where his dad stays when he was young  because he found kids of all races he could feel  home.He also used to celebrate birthdays every year  with his dad,and also christmas.So trevor use to have all those memories while with his dad but later when he was age 13 he lost contact and touch of his dad , dad Robert moved to cape town reason being trevor never had time with his dad and his mom was married by abel and so he had all reason to leave the place.</p>

<p style="color:crimson; background-color:cornsilk;"> Trevor used to live a busy life , surviving in his highschool, surviving in his early twenties,becomig a comedian,but even when his life was moving forward the questions of his dad was at the back of his mind ,he always wonders where his dad is , does he think about him? does he know what he's doing all this questions was popping on his mind , absence of parents would make one have negative thoughts, but the good thing about trevor's mom never talked ill about trevors dad so trevor knows circumstances made them to be apart but not absentism lack of love.</p>

<p style="color:purple; background-color:azure;">His mom always tells him his dad chose him and that he should never forget,so his mom used him to track his dad, and since his dad was so private it was so hard to find him. Trevor decided to find his dad by reaching  his old connections but he never succeeded and then his mom suggested for swissy embassy and then trevor wrote for the swiss embassy asking for his father and the embassy could not give them any information because his name never related with  his dad certificate.Trevour never gave up he kept on writting them untill he finally found his dad . It was one of his weirdest days metting his dad for the first time, it's like he knew him but at the same time never know him at all and so he started interrogetting him and one thing he found is that he's dad is extremely secretive.  </p>
